# Burger Logger

In this assignment, I'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). 

The user will be provided with a field in which they can "create" and log their own unique burger.

After submitting their new burger, it is added to the list of burgers that have not yet been devoured.

Once they choose to "devour" their burger, the page refreshes and the burger is logged in the column that displays all of the devoured burgers.
